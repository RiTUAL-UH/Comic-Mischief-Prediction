In this directory, we provide three JSON files containing Metadata of train/val/test sets. These files also include the name of the videos on YouTube, original subtitles, and their extracted tokens using the BERT model, labels, and some additional information related to each video.

During the training of the model, we load the i3d and vggish features of input videos and audio, respectively. These files have been generated offline and stored in separate directories, which will be read during the training and testing process. 

Due to the large size of the video and audio vectors, please contact me at elaheh.bahar1@gmail.com to request access. The link to the files will be shared via Google Drive.
